      <div class="history">
        Writing a comprehensive history of paper folding is almost impossible,
        since information about the art form prior to the 15th century is
        virtually nonexistent. There are many plausible assertions about its
        origins and early history, but most of those are based on little firm
        documentation. Many studies assert that origami was invented by the
        Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China.
        It is also highly probable that the process of folding was applied to
        other materials before paper was invented, so the origins of
        recreational folding may lie with cloth or leather. Certainly, within
        Europe, the practise of napkin folding and cloth pleating were held in
        high esteem. However, paper has proved to be the ideal material to fold,
        and so it is logical to assume that paper folding followed the discovery
        of the papermaking process.

      <h2>Popularity</h2>
      <div class="row history">
        <div class="col-9 history">
          Today, many people are attracted to the idea of learning how to fold
          origami figures because paper is a cheap craft supply. When origami
          was first practiced, however, it was a craft only for the elite.
          Japanese monks folded origami figures for religious purposes. Origami
          was also used in various formal ceremonies, such as the practice of
          folding paper butterflies to adorn sake bottles at a Japanese couple's
          wedding reception. Tsutsumi, folded paper gift wrappers, were used in
          some ceremonies to symbolize sincerity and purity. Tsuki, folded
          pieces of paper accompanying a valuable gift, are another example of
          ceremonial paper folding since these models would act as a certificate
          of authenticity. As paper became more affordable, common people began
          making origami figures as gifts or creating folded cards and envelopes
          for their correspondence. Origami also started to be used as an
          educational tool, since the folding process involves many concepts
          that are relevant to the study of mathematics. The first book about
          origami was Sembazuru Orikata (Thousand Crane Folding) written by
          Akisato Rito and published in 1797. This book was more about cultural
          customs than a series of instructions, however. There is a traditional
          story in Japan that says if a person folds 1,000 paper cranes, they
          will be granted one special wish.

            Fun Fact Although origami is typically associated with Japan, paper
            folding became popular in Europe, too. In Spain, the practice is
            called papiroflexia or pajarita.

        <h2>Modern Variations</h2>
        Origami did not initially allow any cutting or gluing, but standards
        have loosened considerably over the years. Today, you will see many
        origami books with models that involve some form of cutting or gluing to
        provide increased stability to the final design. Another way in which
        origami has evolved is that figures are no longer folded exclusively
        with origami paper. Today, you can find paper-folding enthusiasts who
        work with wrapping paper, typing paper, scrapbook paper, and various
        forms of handmade paper. There is a "green" crafting trend that involves
        making origami out of paper that would otherwise be discarded, such as
        old newspapers and junk mail inserts. You can also fold origami figures
        from paper currency to present a cash gift in a unique way, although
        this craft requires that you follow diagrams that are created with your
        currency's specific dimensions in mind.
