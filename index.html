              origami, also called paper folding, art of folding objects out of
              paper to create both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
              subjects. The word origami (from Japanese oru [“to fold”] and kami
              [“paper”]) has become the generic description of this art form,

              the Japanese origins of an art that may well have developed
              independently around the world.

      <h2>Why Learn Origami?</h2>
      <div class="why">
        Origami is fun to create, pretty to look at, and surprisingly beneficial
        to your health!

            <span>1-Origami Strengthens Your Brain</span>
          </div>

          <br />
          Think of origami as an exercise for your brain! It requires hand-eye
          coordination, develops fine-motor skills and supports mental
          concentration – all of which stimulate the brain. you get to use both
          the left and right hemispheres of your brain at the same time. It is
          logic plus creativity!! This is essential for proper development. Not
          only does it stimulate our minds, but it also builds imagination and
          memory.

          <div><span>2-Keeps You Healthy, Calm and Relaxed</span></div>
          <br />
          when your hands are engaged in the process of folding the paper, there
          are impulses being sent to your brain and, in turn, releases
          serotonin. Serotonin influences mood and helps us feel happy and calm.
          Furthermore, recent research indicates that it helps you increase
          their overall levels of attention.

          <br />
          origami is a great way to get undrestand about fractions, geometric
          construction, 3D perception, logical thinking and problem-solving. The
          basic concepts of folding paper are founded in mathematical concepts,
          spatial reasoning and problem-solving. Did you know that researchers
          have found that students who have done origami have better math skills
          than their peers?!

          The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. In general,
          these designs begin with a square sheet of paper whose sides may be of
          different colors, prints, or patterns <a href="">Learn!</a>
