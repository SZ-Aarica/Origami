      <h3>3 Main Types of Origami Folds</h3>
      <div>
        When you're new to the art of paper folding, all of the different
        origami terms you encounter can seem very confusing. There are three
        basic folds you need to learn to begin folding simple origami models.

          1 - Valley Fold
          <div>
            The most basic of all origami folds is the valley fold. The valley
            fold gets its name because it makes the paper sink down like a river
            valley. In a traditional origami diagram, a valley fold is indicated
            with dashed lines. To make a valley fold, simply fold part of the
            paper towards you and crease along the dashed line. Sometimes, you
            are asked to fold and unfold the paper after you make a valley fold.
            This is called precreasing. When you make a precrease, you are
            setting the stage for later steps in the diagram. Precreases are
            made at the beginning of the process; it is sometimes too difficult
            to put them into place accurately at a later time. In this photo,
            you can see several valley folds that are usually made to begin an
            origami box.

          2- Mountain Fold
          <div>
            The mountain fold is essentially a valley fold in reverse. A
            mountain fold gets its name because it makes the paper rise up like
            a mountain. In traditional origami diagrams, a mountain fold is
            indicated by a line made of dashes and dots. Sometimes, there will
            also be an arrow that indicates the folding direction. To make a
            mountain fold, fold part of the paper away from you and then crease
            along the line. You can do this by holding the paper in the air and
            folding it. However, it is easier to turn the paper over, fold a
            valley fold, and then turn the paper back to the original position.
            As with a valley fold, you may be asked to fold and unfold the paper
            to create a precrease that will be used later on in the process of
            completing a particular model. In the photo, notice how the creases
            that form a cross appear to rise up from the paper. These creases
            are the mountain folds.

          3- Squash Fold
          <div>
            After mastering the valley fold and the mountain fold, the beginning
            origami enthusiast needs to understand how to make a squash fold.
            The squash fold is essentially a neat way of "squashing" your paper
            into position. It is a compound fold that is a combination of
            creases that are more or less performed simultaneously. As
            illustrated in the photo, you will be precreasing the model. Then,
            you will collapse it into the shape that is shown your instructions
            you are following. Two layers of paper open up from a central point.
            Look at your specific design instructions to get a feel for the
            correct placement of the paper during a squash fold. Some, but not
            all, squash folds are symmetrical. If you make a squash fold that is
            symmetrical when it is supposed to be off towards one side of the
            model will throw off all of the other steps in your project. Once
            you know how to make a squash fold, you can create a variety of
            origami models, ranging from flowers to animals. The origami organ
            base shown in the photo is made using a squash fold. Bases are
            important to know because they are the foundation for making more
            complex origami models.
